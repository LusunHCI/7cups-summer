  - text: Hey, I'm here because of a breakup
  utter_stressor:
  - text: My ex kept changing her mind about me, first telling me that she was interested
      and then ghosting me and then coming back to me before dumping me finally.
  utter_nudging_response:
  - text: So at first it seemed like she was very into me and affectionate, so things
      were going really well. But as time passed, she started to tighten up and I
      thought it was me but she kept reassuring me that she was still interested.
      But then she slowly started to distance herself which scared me again.
