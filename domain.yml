      payload: collapsible
    text: Very sad. I might not be showing it but I can feel it. And sorry if I'm
      a little awkward, it's my first time but this 'breakup' really hit me.

  utter_greeting:
  - text: Hi there. I want to seek some help from 7cups
  utter_open_question_when:
  - text: Like an hour or two ago.
  utter_opinion_question_1:
  - text: Well, the situation is that I'm moving in a year or so and I had asked him
      if he could do long distance. He had said no and he told me he didn't know how
      to tell me he coudlnt. He still loves me, and I do too..but it's better to break
      it off before we get too involved .
  utter_opinion_question_2:
  - text: I didn't want to leave him. I was in denial and just wanted him. He was
      thinking straight and told me it's for the best and he wants to be friends .
      But I don't know how I'm going to take it. I really liked him, to the point
      to love, but losing him already hurt as bad if I lost him next year.
  utter_opinion_question_followup:
  - text: Just losing him. That's what is bothering me. Not bothering me, but I'm
      just heartbroken . I really wish we could have lasted forever. I was head over
      heels for him..and still am. It's not that I need to love someone . I loved
      him , and now I cant. And now I'm going to be jealous because I know girls will
      instantly want to be all over him..because he doesn't have me anymore.
  utter_opinion_question_why_followup:
  - text: He told me that he couldn't stand not seeing me.
  utter_suggestion_cry_accept:
  - text: "Yeah..I guess you are right. I'll try to open up and let out my feelings\
      \ and see how that works out. Thank you for helping, and spending time out of\
      \ your day to help me.(:"
  utter_suggestion_letout_feelings_reject:
  - text: What if I can't let out my feelings? Yes I can cry all day but I hate the
      fact that people will ask what's wrong.
