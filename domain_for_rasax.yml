responses:
  utter_greeting:
  - text: Hey, I'm seeking support with a breakup.
  utter_age:
  - text: I am 22 years old and my girlfriend is 20.
  utter_stressor1:
  - text: So I've been with this girl for 6 months. At first it seemed like she was
      very into me and affectionate, so things were going really well.
  utter_stressor2:
  - text: But as time passed, she started to tighten up and I thought it was me but
      she kept reassuring me that it was just her cultural differences. But then she
      slowly started to distance herself a way with coursework, which scared me again.
  utter_advice_inquiry:
  - text: Oh you have? Do you have any advice for me?
  utter_feelings:
  - text: Yeah, so I started to panic that she was losing interest. So I tried to
      talk to her about it once again, but she just ensured me that her feelings were
      the same and that she was just stressed with work. But then when we met again,
      she said that she didn't feel the same way about me anymore and broke up with
      me.
  utter_breakup_when:
  - text: This was February
  utter_further_details:
  - text: About a week later I saw her in a cafe all alone, so I went over and poured
      my heart to her. She took me back after that and things were great again for
      a while, but then she totally ghosted me again!
  utter_further_contact:
  - text: Eventually I got into contact with her and she revealed that she never really
      developed feelings for me and that I had apparently forced her to stay. She
      was saying that she can’t see a future with us.
  utter_feelings_further_pushy_flirty:
  - text: But honestly it’s so conflicting because SHE was the pushy, flirty one saying
      I love you and then all of a sudden she told me that it was my fault and that
      she never really liked me let alone loved me.
  utter_feelings_further_living_lie:
  - text: So now I’m heartbroken, confused and I feel like I was living a lie.
  utter_commitment:
  - text: Well if she genuinely had no feelings for me or was afraid of commitment,
      I don’t understand why she led me on so long just to find out how she would
      feel. It's especially selfish and cruel to me because she was the one to say
      I adore you first and everything!
  utter_longing:
  - text: It’s just hard because I still like her a lot and miss the good parts of
      our relationship. It hurts to think that she's totally moved on or never really
      felt anything strong enough to have to move on like I do.
  utter_jealousy:
  - text: And it doesn’t help that she randomly started posting a lot of videos of
      her and other guys on her stories all of a sudden. Like why would she suddenly
      do that a day after a break up. Is she trying to hurt me?
  utter_blame_on_ex:
  - text: I just don’t get it. I can honestly say I have done nothing wrong in this
      relationship. She pushed me away and I kept coming back and compromising for
      her. Like if I was horrible, or we didn’t laugh and click, or get intimate I
      could understand, but obviously that wasn't the case.
  utter_shut_out:
  - text: It’s scary how she can shut me out of her life so quickly. I keep wondering
      why she treated me like that.
  utter_hope_to_move_on:
  - text: You're right. I need to stop thinking about her and move on.
  utter_personal_info_inquiry:
  - text: Thank you so much for your help! Before you go, do you think you could give
      me your name and number so I can contact you outside of 7cups?
  utter_gratitude:
  - text: I understand. Thank you so much for your help. I needed to get that off
      my plate.

  - text: See you
