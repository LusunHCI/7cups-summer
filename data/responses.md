## reason
* open_question/reason
    - She told me she broke up with me because she wasn't interested in me. 	
    - She broke up with me because "she didn't have feelings for me" even though she kept telling me she did when we were together	
    - Honestly I don't really know why she broke up with me. She said it was because she didn't have any feelings, but earlier in the relationship she told me she was falling in love with me.	
    - She broke up with me, but her reasoning doesn't make any sense. She claims she never had feelings for me, but during the 6 months we were together she told me she did!	
    - She claims she never felt the same way I did, but throughout our relationship when I confronted her about JUST THAT she kept assuring me she was interested

## inquiry_feelings
* open_question/inquiry_feelings
    - I just can't get over it. Like how can she go from saying she's falling for me to saying she never had feelings for me at all.	
    - I'm just filled with so much hate over her lying. How could she have lied to me like that?
    - It's the lying that's really affecting me. I don't understand how you can go from falling in love with somebody to saying you never had feelings in the first place. 	
    - I just can't believe this is happening. We were both falling in love and now it's all over. 
    - I just don't understand why she didn't breakup with me when she started ghosting me the first time. Why did she have to lie and say she was falling in love with me if she really wasn't and was going to dump me anyway	
    - I'm pissed. She lied, strung me along, and made me believe she was falling for me when in reality she didn't feel anything.

## inquiry_ex_feelings
