- You can do it!!	
- I know it seems like right now it will be hard to get past this, but I know you will. You are stronger than this, and i know I just met you. Don't let her ruin your life and future relationships.
- Listen, my friend. You are fun to talk to, you are obviously smart and i 100% believe that he felt about you the way you said.

- Its okay to be sad okay	
- There is nothing much to do, you just need to carry on. And even if eventually she comes to you. Don’t push her away	
- it's so hard to accept, but you have to remind yourself that you are valuable and your needs are important and you deserve someone who can be there for you as much as you want to be there for them	
- Hmm -- it seems like you want to improve yourself, which is all very good. But I think the way you are trying to do so might be also impacting your self-esteem.	
- Yes, in your own space if you feel good that's great. This means you're on the right path to establishing a better self.
