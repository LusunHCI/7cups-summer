## intent:stressor_inquiry_why
- Do you know why you might feel this way?
- Why did you break-up?

## intent:label_emotion_stressor_introduction
- You seem very sad and confused by her behavior. 

## intent:reflection_stressor_introduction
- You really liked this girl and it seemed like she felt the same way, but then she started being more and more distant. 

## intent:condolence_stressor_introduction
- I'm sorry that she was becoming more and more distant.

## intent:empathy_stressor_introduction
- I've been in similar situations with my relationships. It can be hard to deal with emotional distance like that. 

## intent:no_advice
- I am not supposed to give advice, because I don't know what's gonna happen with your own situation, but I can continue to give you comfort and listen to you.
- I do not want to give you advice, making you think I know what's gonna happen. I just believe it'd be good to focus on yourself, to know how long you are capable of accepting this 
- I'm not really allowed to do that. But I think the way you're trying to solve this is good and that you shouldn't feel any regrets no matter what happens

## intent:label_emotion_detail
- It seems like you are very frustrated by her ghosting you.

## intent:reflection_reunion_detail
- So you got back together, but then she started distancing herself like before.

## intent:condolence_reunion_detail
- I'm sorry that she kept ghosting you like that.

## intent:empathy_reunion_detail
- I know how it feels to be ghosted. It sucks, especially when things are going really well. 

## intent:further_contact_inquiry
- Did you ever hear from her after that?

## intent:reflection_further_contact
- So it seems she never felt the same way.

## intent:condolence_further_contact
- I'm sorry that she strung you along like that. 

## intent:empathy_further_contact
- It's so hard hearing that a person you like doesn't feel the same way.

## intent:label_emotion_conflicting
- You're right, that's so conflicting! Seems you feel very confused.

## intent:commitment_inquiry
- Maybe this girl was scared of commitment? Or she had a tendency to screw something up if it was going too good? It feels like she was running away from it because it was too perfect.

## intent:support_user_side
- The bottomline seems to be that this girl had a lot of power over you, and you being genuine into her has left you feeling heartbroken. 
- You need to understand how toxic this was for you
- Even if it wasn’t her intent, she ended up manipulating you
- And you deserve better than this
- When you love someone, it can be really hard to see what's going on or decide to leave.
- You keep hoping that it gets better or they see what they're doing to you - after all, they love you too, right?
- i feel you, it seems like he wasn’t worth it. you have to remember how he made you feel.
- he isn’t worth your time, sweety. and i know this is really hard to think of.
- you weren’t wrong about anything.
- you deserve better than that
- There is no fault in you I guess

## intent:empathy_longing
- I totally get that.

## intent:empathy_jealousy
- Maybe she wanted you to think that she was already over it. People often do that to hurt the other person more. 

## intent:label_emotion_jealous
- You’re left feeling heartbroken, wondering if she’ll regret her decision, hoping she’ll realise she made a mistake.

## intent:encourage_self
- All these thoughts take up a lot of mental space. They make it hard to be in the moment, and think about yourself.
- I think it'd be a good idea to focus on yourself, to ask yourself whether you'd be ready to wait in uncertainty for his return, if yes then how long 
- You have to try your positive side to know it
- Therefore you're with yourself, so focus on yourself, even if I know how terrible you might feel this pain 
- Make Peace With The Past. It's hard to march forward when you feel like there are things holding you back

## intent:condolence_lack_of_closure
- It sucks that you really loved her and she left you without proper closure

## intent:encourage_healing_and_overcoming
- You need to stop thinking about the possibilities and reasons and you need to allow yourself to heal from this

## intent:encourage_learning_from_this_experience
- Let this experience be an example for you. Learn from it
Don’t ever let yourself get hurt like that again and always remember that you deserve better than to be led on and ghosted."

## intent:reject_personal_info
- Sorry, I don't feel comfortable giving you my personal information. But feel free to continue to reach out to me on 7cups. I'll always be here for you!

## intent:accompany
- So be sure that you'll always have someone for you whenever you want, that's me :)
