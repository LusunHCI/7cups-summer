  utter_advice_inquiry:
  - text: Oh you have? Do you have any advice for me?
  utter_age:
  - text: I am 22 years old and my girlfriend is 20.
  utter_blame_on_ex:
  - text: I just don’t get it. I can honestly say I have done nothing wrong in this
      relationship. She pushed me away and I kept coming back and compromising for
      her. Like if I was horrible, or we didn’t laugh and click, or get intimate I
      could understand, but obviously that wasn't the case.
  utter_breakup_when:
  - text: This was February
  utter_commitment:
  - text: Well if she genuinely had no feelings for me or was afraid of commitment,
      I don’t understand why she led me on so long just to find out how she would
      feel. It's especially selfish and cruel to me because she was the one to say
      I adore you first and everything!
  utter_end_conversation:
  - text: See you
  utter_feelings:
  - text: Yeah, so I started to panic that she was losing interest. So I tried to
      talk to her about it once again, but she just ensured me that her feelings were
      the same and that she was just stressed with work. But then when we met again,
      she said that she didn't feel the same way about me anymore and broke up with
      me.
  utter_feelings_further_living_lie:
  - custom:
      data:
      - description: You're right, that's so conflicting! Seems you feel very confused.
        title: Label emotion
      payload: collapsible
    text: So now I’m heartbroken, confused and I feel like I was living a lie.
  utter_feelings_further_pushy_flirty:
  - text: But honestly it’s so conflicting because SHE was the pushy, flirty one saying
      I love you and then all of a sudden she told me that it was my fault and that
      she never really liked me let alone loved me.
  utter_further_contact:
  - custom:
      data:
      - description: So it seems she never felt the same way.
        title: Reflecttion
      - description: I'm sorry that she strung you along like that.
        title: Condolence
      - description: It's so hard hearing that a person you like doesn't feel the
          same way.
        title: Empathy
      payload: collapsible
    text: Eventually I got into contact with her and she revealed that she never really
      developed feelings for me and that I had apparently forced her to stay. She
      was saying that she can’t see a future with us.
  utter_further_details:
  - custom:
      data:
      - description: So you got back together, but then she started distancing herself
          like before.
        title: Reflecttion
      - description: It seems like you are very frustrated by her ghosting you.
        title: Label emotion
      - description: I'm sorry that she kept ghosting you like that.
        title: Condolence
      - description: I know how it feels to be ghosted. It sucks, especially when
          things are going really well.
        title: Empathy
      payload: collapsible
    text: About a week later I saw her in a cafe all alone, so I went over and poured
      my heart to her. She took me back after that and things were great again for
      a while, but then she totally ghosted me again!
  utter_gratitude:
  - text: I understand. Thank you so much for your help. I needed to get that off
      my plate.
  utter_greeting:
  - text: Hey, I'm seeking support with a breakup.
  utter_hope_to_move_on:
  - custom:
      data:
      - description: Let this experience be an example for you. Learn from it. Don’t
          ever let yourself get hurt like that again and always remember that you
          deserve better than to be led on and ghosted.
        title: Encourage
      payload: collapsible
    text: You're right. I need to stop thinking about her and move on.
  utter_jealousy:
  - custom:
      data:
      - description: You’re left feeling heartbroken, wondering if she’ll regret her
          decision, hoping she’ll realise she made a mistake.
        title: Label emotion
      - description: All these thoughts take up a lot of mental space. They make it
          hard to be in the moment, and think about yourself.
        title: Encourage
      - description: Maybe she wanted you to think that she was already over it. People
          often do that to hurt the other person more.
        title: Empathy
      payload: collapsible
    text: And it doesn’t help that she randomly started posting a lot of videos of
      her and other guys on her stories all of a sudden. Like why would she suddenly
      do that a day after a break up. Is she trying to hurt me?
  utter_longing:
  - custom:
      data:
      - description: I totally get that.
        title: Empathy
      payload: collapsible
    text: It’s just hard because I still like her a lot and miss the good parts of
      our relationship. It hurts to think that she's totally moved on or never really
      felt anything strong enough to have to move on like I do.
  utter_personal_info_inquiry:
  - text: Thank you so much for your help! Before you go, do you think you could give
      me your name and number so I can contact you outside of 7cups?
  utter_shut_out:
  - custom:
      data:
      - description: You need to stop thinking about the possibilities and reasons
          and you need to allow yourself to heal from this.
        title: Encourage
      payload: collapsible
    text: It’s scary how she can shut me out of her life so quickly. I keep wondering
      why she treated me like that.
  utter_stressor1:
  - text: So I've been with this girl for 6 months. At first it seemed like she was
      very into me and affectionate, so things were going really well.
  utter_stressor2:
  - custom:
      data:
      - description: You really liked this girl and it seemed like she felt the same
          way, but then she started being more and more distant.
        title: Reflecttion
      - description: You seem very sad and confused by her behavior.
        title: Label emotion
      - description: I'm sorry that she was becoming more and more distant.
        title: Condolence
      - description: I've been in similar situations with my relationships. It can
          be hard to deal with emotional distance like that.
        title: Empathy
      payload: collapsible
    text: But as time passed, she started to tighten up and I thought it was me but
      she kept reassuring me that it was just her cultural differences. But then she
      slowly started to distance herself a way with coursework, which scared me again.
